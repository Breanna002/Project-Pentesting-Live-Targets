# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking Fixation

Description: Session Hijacking Fixation is using two browsers but you are logged in on one but not the other. You use PHPSESSIONID to change the PHPSESSIONID on the browser that is not logged in to the same PHPSESSIONID that is logged in. And it will log you automtically.

Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection

Description: SQL Injection is using 'OR SLEEP(5)=0--' in the URL which becomes %27%20OR%20SLEEP(5)--27% to be able to pause the DQL query for 5 or more seconds.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Emumeration

Description: Username Emumernation is when it tells us when a account does not exist. It will tell us login is unsuccessful in bold. If the account does not exist it will not be in bold but there are only certian accounts that are valid.

Vulnerability #2: Cross Site Scripting

Description: Cross Site Scripting is using <script> to make sure no one gets in. If someone tries to get into someone information it will automatically execute it.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference 

Description: Insecure Direct Object reference is someone can get into your information very easily by looking at your ID number. If your ID number is short then you will automatically be hacked easily but if your number is hard then you won't be hacked into.

Vulnerability #2: Cross Site Request Forgery

Description: Cross Site Request Forgery is to perform a CSRF attack. Basically making someone click on a page that does not show anyting. I got stuck on this vulnerability, could you direct me in what I did wrong ?
